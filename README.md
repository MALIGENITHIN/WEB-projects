# WEB-projects
This repository contains a collection of my web-based projects, built using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern web tools. These projects demonstrate my ability to develop responsive, user-friendly, and interactive web applications, as well as my understanding of front-end and back-end technologies.
